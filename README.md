# HAR Baseline
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is nowadays an active researcharea, primarily due to the diffusion of electronic devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, video cameras, and standalone sensors (e.g., inertial or physio-logical) present in our daily lives. However, one of the mainlimitations of the existing methodologies is  that it does not exist a standardworkflow that, given a HAR learning dataset, produces a first baseline estimation of some basic pattern recognition modelsâ€™  quality. Furthermore, the steps of such a workflow have to be explicitly manually defined. For such purpose, this package focuses on the definition, standardization, and development of workflow for human activity recognition in depth analysis.
